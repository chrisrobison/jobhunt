EXPERIENCE
––––––––––
D. Harris Tours, Inc.
Chief Technology Officer 
Feb 2020 - Current

D Harris Tours is a shuttle bus transportation company which offers 22-44 passenger buses for hire. The majority of their business is derived from schools (student event transportation) and local tours. 10 years ago, I developed and implemented software that allowed D Harris to grow from 2 buses to 12. But the system I implemented 10 years ago was not made for the increased number of drivers, buses, customers and trips the company had grown to serve. Hired as CTO where I updated and enhanced their systems with modern tools to better manage the growing company; real-time bus data, automated maintenance notifications, automated trip confirmations and notifications via email and SMS and more. After reviewing the first months trip data, I found that drivers would often sit idle for 4-5 hours, waiting to pickup students they had dropped off at a football game or band practice. I developed an algorithm to identify these idle times and match them with jobs. I offered drivers an extra hours pay if they did the extra trip. This nearly doubled the daily revenue until the COVID-19 shutdown.

	- Automated notifications for trips, bus maintenance
	- Automated billing and invoicing
	- Implemented digital documentation required by Federal law and in compliance with Department of Transportation (DOT) & California Highway Patrol (CHP) requirements 
	- Doubled daily revenue by implementing algorithms for better trip and resource optimization
