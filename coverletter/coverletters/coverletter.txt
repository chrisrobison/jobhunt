Subject: Application for position {{POSITION}} at {{COMPANY}}

Dear {{CONTACT}},

I am writing to express my interest in the "{{POSITION}}" position at {{COMPANY}}, as advertised. With my extensive experience in software engineering and leadership roles, I am confident in my ability to contribute significantly to your organization.

Most recently, I served as the Chief Technology Officer at D. Harris Tours, Inc. Here, I successfully led the development and implementation of business processes and technology that allowed the company to grow from a fleet of two buses to twelve. Notably, I designed and implemented route optimization algorithms, which increased the company's daily revenue by 30%. I also automated various processes including trip confirmations, bus maintenance notifications, and billing and invoicing. I believe these accomplishments underscore my initiative, technical acumen, and my ability to lead successful product-focused teams.

Prior to D. Harris Tours, I held the role of Manager, Software Engineering at Conversant, Inc., where I led both the Rich Media Ad team and the Mobile Ad team. I was responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of infrastructure and codebase serving millions of mobile and rich media ads each day. My work there exemplifies my solid understanding of SaaS application technologies and my proficiency in the Java ecosystem. I was also heavily involved in modernizing the ad serving infrastructure and metric collection, in addition to contributing to the IAB MRAID 2.0 standard.

Apart from my technical expertise, I pride myself on being a proactive problem solver and a dedicated leader who mentors, coaches, and nurtures the growth of my team. I have always been passionate about enhancing the customer experience and ensuring that I adapt to rapidly changing technologies in my work environment.

My collaborative skills and experiences with managing cross-functional relationships, combined with my motivation to take the initiative in a constantly-changing work environment, align with the preferred qualifications of your advertised role. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Backblaze's ongoing success, leveraging my experience and passion for software engineering and team leadership.

I appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to the possibility of discussing this exciting opportunity further.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
