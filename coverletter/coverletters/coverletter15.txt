Dear Mr. Kahle,

My name is Christopher Robison and I am writing to express my interest in the Director of Platform Engineering position at Internet Archive. I came across the Director of Platform Engineering job posting on your website after attending the Dweb Camp event last week. I currently work as the CTO of D Harris Tours, a small transportation company with a fleet of 14 buses but the owner of the company is planning to retire in a few months and will be selling the company, so I have begun the long and arduous process of finding a new job.

I had previously met Wendy Hanamura at a meeting with the Stellar Development Foundation at your headquarters in San Francisco back in April, 2024. She introduced me to Dweb Camp and we ended up scheduling the buses for the event through my company, D Harris Tours. Once I started my job search, the Internet Archive was one of the first places I looked for open positions and I was very excited to see that there was an open position that sounded like it was made specifically for my experience and skillset. I sent Wendy an email asking who the hiring manager would be for the Director of Plaform Engineering role and she replied that it was you, so here I am to "throw my hat in the ring".

I have been a long-time friend and supporter of the Internet Archive and the work you do. From the Wayback Machine to archiving media of all types, I share the IA's position that there should be "universal access to all knowledge". In addition to my extensive technology skills, I have an excellent understanding of copyright law, especially as it pertains to digital media and have been closely following your recent court cases. I understand how important a role the "First-Sale" doctrine has had in equitable access to knowledge and I am appalled at how the publishing industry is basically making and end-run around the one law that has been most influential in keeping knowledge accessible for everyone with their overpriced licensing schemes for ebooks. 

I would love an opportunity to discuss the Director of Platform Engineering role with you as I believe I would be an excellant addition to your team. I have the technical skills, background and experience needed as well as a passion for the free dissemination of knowledge. I'm even familiar with your tech stack thanks to a impromptu tech talk by one of your employees at one of the Friday 
 afternoon tours. The rest of this letter is basically boilerplate background about me. I can be reached by phone at (415) 810-6991 or email at cdr@cdr2.com. I look forward to hearing from you!
